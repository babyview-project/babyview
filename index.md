## About the BabyView

The BabyView camera is designed to collect high-resolution, at-home egocentric video data from children 6 - 30 months of age. The camera consists of a rotated GoPro Black Bones camera attached to a lightweight baby safety helmet using a custom 3D printed mount and attached to a rechargeable 9V battery. The BabyView camera was designed in collaboration with Daylight, Inc., a product-design firm in San Francisco, CA, and and is the result of more than a year of prototyping.

All design documentation, safety testing protocols, assembly instructions, pilot data, data management protocols, and sample participant instructions can be found at https://osf.io/kwvxu/.

## Brief overview

### Camera choice 
Our goal was to capture a toddler’s field of view and their interactions as accurately as possible while also providing head tracking data. We found that the GoPro Hero Bones meet these needs with a ~100°+ FOV, Gyroscope, accelerometer, high resolution video and recording time up to 45-60 with this current battery choice. Data is recorded onto micro SD cards which can hold up to 256G. During our experimentation with the GoPros, we determined that orienting the camera vertically at an angle neutral to the face place of the child was preferable because it enables the camera to capture both adult faces and objects within a child’s hands in the same image; see example images below.
